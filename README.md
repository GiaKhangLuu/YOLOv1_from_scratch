# **Introduction** 

Building YOLOv1 from scratch based on Tensorflow/Keras framework. The fruits dataset contains three categories like apple, banana and orange. This model detects these fruits on the image and draw bounding on it. The dataset contains 240 training images with four categories (apple, banana, orange, mixed), and the test set contains 60 images. The model was trained approximately 10000 epochs and that lasts total over 4 days.
